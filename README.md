### Why Humboldt as a Name? ###
This framework is named after a penguin.  A rather amazing penguin species called Humboldt Penguins.  These birds live in costal regions of southern parts of South America, like Peru.  To learn more, the St. Louis Zoo in St. Louis MS, USA, has an amazing exhibit of the wonderful birds.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Just run and let wild.  To start a new application, run the tool with the option --new={name of project}.  This will create the skeleton directory and get you started.
* Configuration is handled in Lua files, just open the Config
* Dependencies - So far none.
* Database configuration - Working on this
* How to run tests - Tests?  You think my ADD brain will let me write proper tests?
* Deployment instructions - In the root directory of your project, just run humboldt and a server will open.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests - We need these like badly
* Code review - This code no doubt sucks.  Tell me how.
* Other guidelines

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Jason Marshall <JasonMarshallSelene@gmail.com>
* I want somewhere to have a community discussion, maybe Discord?  Let me actually get this going and find some volunteers to help with this.
